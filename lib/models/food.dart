      'STEP 2:\n  Leave some of the remaining butter in the mug and use the rest to butter a second 300ml mug.\n If you want to turn out the cakes at the end, line the mugs with baking parchment.\n It’s easiest to put a piece in the base of each mug, then another around the inside wall. You will get neater edges if you cover the inside fully.',
